    "For lower utilization values (ρ = 0.01) , the IAT and WT are mostly uncorrelated (-0.056). This makes sense as under low utilization, there are very little chances that the packet will be queued. Still, the negative sign is significant as it shows that if the IAT is low, meaning to packets arrive within a short time, the second will probably have to wait. In the case of the IAT and ST, they are uncorrelated (-0.002) as they are independent random variable by definition of the model. In consequence, the IAT and the SysT (WT + ST) can only be less or equally correlated as the IAT and WT. In effect, the IAT and the SysT have a (-0.011) negligible correlation coefficient. It is different for the ST and the SysT, as the latter is a function of the service time. We observe a 0.988 correlation coefficient which depicts this strong dependence. Under low utilization values, the waiting time is very small and the system time mostly depends on the service time. Regarding the WT, from the output in 4.2.1 it can be observed that no lag value yields any relevant correlation value. This makes sense as under low utilization the queue is mostly empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "For utilization values $\\in \\{0.5, 0.8\\}$ we observe a more intense negative correlation between the IAT and WT as well as between the IAT and SysT for the same reasons as explained in the previous paragraph. As it should, the IAT and the ST remain uncorrelated. When it comes to the waiting time, it desires more attention for these utilization values. We observe that the lower lag values in the 1 to 20 range start to indicate some auto-correlation. This is due to the fact that if the WT was large, it means that the queue contained some packets.  The higher the utilization value, the higher number of packets will be queued and consecutive time indexes will observe a similar waiting time. For ρ = 0.5, the auto-correlation fades away from lag sizes of 1 to 10. While for ρ = 0.8 it does not fade away in the 1 to 20 lag size range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, for ρ = 0.9, the IAT and WT, IAT and ST, and IAT and SysT behave as in the previous paragraph. As the utilization is so high, the queue remains full for the whole simulation and therefore, the WT is highly auto-correlated for all lag values.\n"

    "- The Serving and the System time are positively correlated. It is very evident when considering the ρ = 0.01 case, as the waiting time is mostly null, and the system time is determined by the serving time. They clearly have a linear relation. With the higher utilization, as the waiting time gains more weight in the system time calculation, this relation faces away, although it is still observable."

    "We can observe that the auto-correlation results depend on the number of processed packets. Because of this dependency, the observation windows of the experiment needs to be carefully chosen.  Otherwise, we could make false-assumptions. The problem with N=100 is that the warm-up phase of the experiment has too much contribution to the results. In order to reduce the weight of the warm-up phase we need to simulate longer."
